My R learning journey. Practical code snippets, plots, and markdown magic for beginners.

# My Notes on Using R

Welcome to my R learning journey! This repository contains practical code snippets, visualizations, and markdown magic—designed especially for beginners exploring R and the tidyverse.

## What's Inside

- Hands-on examples using `ggplot2` for data visualization  
- Tips for working with R Markdown and RStudio Cloud  
- Clean, reproducible code with helpful annotations  
- Explorations using the `palmerpenguins` dataset and more

## Getting Started

To follow along:

1. Install the required packages:
   ```r
   install.packages("tidyverse")
   install.packages("palmerpenguins")
   ```

2. Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio or RStudio Cloud  
3. Knit to HTML or GitHub-flavored markdown to view the output

## Why This Repo?

I created this as a personal reference and a way to share what I’m learning with others. If you're just starting out with R, I hope it helps you too!
